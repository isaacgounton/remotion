From Remotion version v4.0.274, there has been an inadvertent change that breaks some workflows on Lambda that expect Chrome to have been compiled proprietary video codecs

## When you are affected

You are affected if you:

- are on Remotion version 4.0.274 or higher
- are using Remotion Lambda
- are using the [getVideoMetadata()](/docs/get-video-metadata) API from [@remotion/media-utils](/docs/media-utils) or the `<Video>` tag with an MP4 file

## Workarounds

- Option 1: Revert to Remotion version 4.0.273
- Option 2: Replace [getVideoMetadata()](/docs/renderer/get-video-metadata) with [parseMedia()](/docs/media-parser/parse-media) and `<Video>` with `<OffthreadVideo>` if you can. We recommend both of these in general.

## Solution

We need to swap the Chrome binary with one that supports proprietary codecs.

This is not easy as there no official binaries for arm64 on Amazon Linux 2023 and we obtained ours through a vendor, which we are contacting.

If we cannot get a binary from a vendor, we’ll compile one ourselves and release it in a future Remotion update.

## Apologies

We are sorry for this oversight from our side and the troubles it may cause.

We’ll add tests to Remotion Lambda to ensure this issue cannot happen in the future.
